# Data-Driven Approach

## User Preference Analysis

A rules-based system that:

- Tracks which property attributes appear most frequently in a user's viewed and favorited listings
- Assigns numerical weights to features based on viewing time and favoriting behavior
- Identifies patterns in location preferences, price ranges, and amenity selections

### Template-Based Description Generation

Develop a robust template system with:

- A library of pre-written sentence structures for different property types and features
- Dynamic placeholders that pull in specific property attributes
- Logic-based selection of which templates to use based on the property's match to user preferences

## Implementation Steps

1. **Database Structure**
   Your current schema already has good support for this with models like `FavoriteListing`, `VisitedListing`, and detailed property attributes in the `Listing` model.

2. **User Preference Calculation**
   - Create algorithms that calculate preference scores for each property attribute
   - Implement frequency analysis to identify recurring patterns in user behavior
   - Develop a ranking system for property features based on historical interactions

3. **Template Management**
   - Build a comprehensive library of template sentences organized by property type, feature category, and target audience
   - Create logic for template selection based on property-to-preference matching scores
   - Implement string interpolation to insert property-specific details into templates

4. **Description Assembly**
   - Develop an algorithm that selects and arranges templates in a logical order
   - Include conditional logic that emphasizes features matching user preferences
   - Implement readability checks to ensure natural-sounding flow between sentences

## Technical Considerations

- Use statistical methods to identify significant patterns in user behavior
- Implement a scoring system that weighs recency of interactions (more recent views/favorites count more)
- Create a feedback mechanism where user engagement with generated descriptions informs future improvements
- Consider A/B testing different template styles to determine which drives more engagement
